The ipynb files uploaded can be executed directly by just changing the following parameters:
video_path = "/content/baby.mp4"
saving_path = "/content/magnified_video_baby.mp4"
level = 4
alpha = 100
low_omega = 0.833
high_omega = 1
attenuation = 1
(Example shown)
The results will be saved in results and me_results respectively where results refers to the magnified videos and me_results refer to the motion extracted and magnified videos. We have also provided one sample input video name baby.mp4 in data directory.
